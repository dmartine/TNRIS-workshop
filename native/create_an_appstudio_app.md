###Create an AppStudio App

[AppStudio for ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/appstudio) allows you to easily build native apps from existing web maps and templates for Android, iOS, Window, Mac OS X and Linux. You can also build custom apps from scratch with Qt/QML. Visit the [help](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/appstudio/) for more information.

In this lab, you will use AppStudio to build an iOS and an Android native app from a single webmap.

2. Scroll down to the Map Viewer section and click `start with this template`.

3. Sign in with your ArcGIS developer or Organization account.

5. Enter in a title for your app. For the `Thumbail` image use the beerthumbail_200.png.

9. Congrats you just created your first native app with AppStudio. To view it before you build the binaries for your plaform of choice you can use AppStudio Player for ArcGIS in iOS or Android. If you have a device that supports one of these operating systems go ahead and download it from the App Store or Google Play. 

 * If you don't have an iOS or Android go to step 11. 

10. Open AppStudio Player and `Sign In` to view your apps. Select the app you just created and select `Yes` to download the selected app to your device. Once the download is complete click `OK`. Select the app again and you now have that app running in AppStudio Player.  

11. You can also view your application on your desktop before you build the binaries. Click [this link] (http://appstudio.arcgis.com/download.html) to download AppStudio for ArcGIS Desktop edition.

12. Open AppStudio for ArcGIS on your desktop and click `Sign In`. Click the thumbnail icon for your app and select `Yes` to download the selected app to your computer. After the download completes double click your app and now have that app running in AppStudio Player.
